**Textbook:** A First Course in Finite Elements (Jacob Fish, Ted Belytschko)

**Description:** Introduction to computational techniques for the simulation of a large variety of engineered systems. The applicability to real-world engineering problems is stressed throughout the course. The course provides an introduction to finite element methods for analysis of steady-state and transient problems in solid, structural, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Modeling of problems and interpretation of numerical results. Implementation of simple MATLAB codes and use of existing general-purpose programs (ABAQUS).  Final project addressing a significant problem arising in engineered systems.

**Prerequisites:** Engineering Sciences 120 and 123 or equivalent introduction to the mechanics of deformable materials and fluids.

**Grading:**<br/>
Homework (25%)<br/>
Two Mid-Term Exams (25% each)<br/>
Project (25%)

**Homework:**

* Homework is mandatory in order to pass the course.

* No late homework can be accepted, as the solutions will be posted on the day that homework is collected.

* All homework assignments will be given/announced on Wednesday and are due on the following Wednesday (one week - unless other instructions are provided).

* All homework will be submitted through Gradescope.

* Homework will consist of a combination of Paper, Matlab and Abaqus problems

* Discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to doing academic work. For assignments in this course, you are encouraged to consult with your classmates as you work on problem sets. However, after discussing with peers, make sure that you can work through the problem yourself and ensure that any answers you submit for evaluation are the result of your own efforts. In addition, you must cite any books, articles, websites, lectures, etc that have helped you with your work using appropriate citation practices. Similarly, you must list the names of students with whom you have collaborated on problem sets

**Project:**

* A 5 minute report to the class regarding the plan of the project

* Groups of 2-3 people

* Project should involve “serious” computation using ABAQUS/MATLAB

* Intermediate presentation + Report

* A final presentation (15 minutes) + Report
